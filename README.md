# Reacher Project 


This code is for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Course' second projcet. In this project, I used Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to solve the Reacher environment.

## Environment

This project uses the reacher environment from Unity environment.

- State space is continous with size of 33.

- Action space is continous with size of 4, each in the [-1,1].
